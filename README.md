# DSA-Labs
open-source labs in Java for the Data Structures and Algorithm Design course

## Motivation
This repository aims to share the author's DSA labs. All the codes were written by the author. These codes are NOT allowed for any purposes of cheating or other abusing.

## Management
This repository is for displaying only and NO commitment will be accepted. However, you may feel free to open issues.
Codes will be uploaded approximately one week after the lab's submission time so as to prevent copying.

## Programming Info
The codes were written corresponding to the JDK 8 documentation. The author uses VS Code so you may see the .vscode folder, so it's more convenient for VS Coders to run these programs with Java plugins.

## Contact
If you have any questions, open an issue or email honminden@outlook.com.
